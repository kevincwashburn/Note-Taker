## Description
This web-based application allows the user to create, save, and delete notes. Each note consists of a title and body. The save icon saves the note and its contents to the left hand sidebar of the webpage. Clicking on the note will bring it up to be read. Finally, the trash can icon beside each note in the sidebar will erase the desired note when clicked.
